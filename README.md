Symmetric AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption is a widely used cryptographic algorithm for securing data. It is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data, typically 128 bits (16 bytes). It uses a series of transformations, including substitution, permutation, and mixing of data, to securely scramble the input data.
